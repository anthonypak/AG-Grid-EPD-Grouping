The Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) defines uncoated carbon steel reinforcing bars as reinforcing steel bars produced to ASTM A615, A706, or A996 specifications; in other words, black bars [15]. Black rebar provides superior cost effectiveness for applications where epoxy and anti-rust coatings are not needed.  Rebar's surface is often patterned to form a better bond with the concrete [17]. There are a number of ways to identify rebar from the production mill  to the fabrication shop to the jobsite. Each individual reinforcing bar is manufactured with a series of individual markings [16] – see Figure 1:  - The first letter or symbol identifies the producing mill;- The next marking is the bar size;- The third marking symbol designates the type of reinforcing steel — usually either ""S"" for carbon-steel (ASTM A615) or ""W"" for low-alloy steel (ASTM A706);- Finally, there will be a grade marking (60, 75, 80, 100, 120) or by the addition of one line (60) or two lines (75), three lines (80, 100), or four lines (120) that must be at least five deformations long.Rebar is used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. The most common steel rebar used in concrete products are manufactured in compliance with ASTM A615. ASTM A615 states that welding of A615 steel should be approached with caution since no specific provisions have been included to enhance its weldability [12].

Reinforcement rebars are embedded within concrete to enhance its tensile strength and provide structural integrity, especially in applications where the concrete might be subjected to tension forces or other forms of stress.
Stainless steel rebars are distinct from conventional carbon steel rebars in that they are made from stainless steel, which is a type of alloy that contains chromium and other elements to provide corrosion resistance and durability. This corrosion resistance is a key advantage of stainless steel rebars, making them suitable for use in environments where exposure to moisture, chemicals, or other corrosive substances might degrade the performance of conventional carbon steel rebars.
Stainless steel rebars are commonly used in applications where the concrete structure will be exposed to harsh environments, such as marine environments, industrial settings, or areas with high levels of chloride ions (which can accelerate corrosion in carbon steel). They are also used in structures where long-term durability and reduced maintenance are important considerations.
Stainless steel rebars come in various grades and specifications, each designed for specific applications and environments. The selection of the appropriate grade of stainless steel rebar depends on factors such as the intended use, exposure conditions, and engineering requirements of the concrete structure.",ec3gjgfj,47065,45238,https://cqddatastore.blob.core.windows.net/cqd/images/47c368fc54e9484d8c1640939b8320a6.png,,,Reinforcing bar used together with concrete.,1000 kg,,,,PlantGroup,,2480 kgCO2e,FALSE,,,,0.152,0,2.48,,,,,,-2.48

Reinforcement Sheerness factory. The rebar is cut and bent as per
requirements specified for the projects on site. Once the rebar is laid,
concrete is poured and the required structure is formed once the concrete
is hardened. The use of rebar in the concrete acts as a tension device in
reinforced concrete in order to strengthen and bond with the concrete,
making it ideal to use for structures such as slabs. The following sizes of
the cut and bent hot rolled ribbed reinforcement steel can be used for
reinforcing the concrete: 8mm, 10mm, 12mm, 16mm, 20mm, 25mm,

The advantage is that a single bolt is effective for immediate work protection at the face after torque tensioning, while later gaining additional corrosion protection by the grouting. The combination bolt may be used for most ground conditions, but excluding ground subjected to strain bursting and very large contour convergence. The injected grout improves the corrosion protection provided by the plastic grout pipe and the Pc-Coat. Such bolts are therefore highly attractive for very corrosive environments like subsea tunnels. The end-anchorage with tensioning of the rebar, plastic grouting pipe and the cementitious mortar embedment creates a very stiff system offering extended durability. Any tunnel may cross zones of variable need of corrosion protection for bolts, but to classify the exposure level may be difficult. One mitigation strategy may be to use the well protected Combination Bolt along all of the tunnel length. The NC-Bolt and Pc-Bolt may be used under most ground conditions, except when very high rock stresses may produce large radial deformations or strain bursting.

Reinforcement rebars are embedded within concrete to enhance its tensile strength and provide structural integrity, especially in applications where the concrete might be subjected to tension forces or other forms of stress.
Stainless steel rebars are distinct from conventional carbon steel rebars in that they are made from stainless steel, which is a type of alloy that contains chromium and other elements to provide corrosion resistance and durability. This corrosion resistance is a key advantage of stainless steel rebars, making them suitable for use in environments where exposure to moisture, chemicals, or other corrosive substances might degrade the performance of conventional carbon steel rebars.
Stainless steel rebars are commonly used in applications where the concrete structure will be exposed to harsh environments, such as marine environments, industrial settings, or areas with high levels of chloride ions (which can accelerate corrosion in carbon steel). They are also used in structures where long-term durability and reduced maintenance are important considerations.
Stainless steel rebars come in various grades and specifications, each designed for specific applications and environments. The selection of the appropriate grade of stainless steel rebar depends on factors such as the intended use, exposure conditions, and engineering requirements of the concrete structure.",ec35a2af,47065,45238,https://cqddatastore.blob.core.windows.net/cqd/images/c52bbda4ef06435fbbe01fa67752e491.png,,,Reinforcing bar used together with concrete.,1000 kg,,,,Plant,,2670 kgCO2e,FALSE,,,,0.152,0,2.67,,,,,,-2.67

By means of baskets, they are then loaded into the smelting furnace and brought to the liquid state in a matter of minutes.  The new fume suction and filtering system drastically reduces the environmental impact and enables to assess the excellent quality of the scrap loads used through chemical and radiometric controls. Billet production  The molten metal is transferred from the smelting furnace to the ladle. Samples are taken for accurate chemical and radiometric analyses to determine precisely the characteristics of each steel casting.  The ladle then reaches the continuous casting plant, the liquid steel is poured into special copper ingot moulds and left to solidify in a controlled fashion to take the form of billets, the semi-finished product ready for subsequent rolling. Reinforcing Bar Production The reheating furnace, required to bring the billet to rolling temperature, operates on a continuous cycle and is powered directly by the heat recovered from the continuous casting plant and by natural gas burners.  By  so  doing,  great  energy  savings  are  achieved  and  environmental  impact  is  remarkably reduced.

Compared with H- and I-beam profiles and U-channels, the closed shape of hollow profiles means that, for a given cross-sectional area, they have much better resistance to twisting. The steel grades used for cold- and hot-formed hollow profiles are most often weldable, low-carbon constructional steels with an iron content of 98% or more. As with other steel products, hollow profiles used in building and civil engineering constructions can at the end of their useful life be recovered and recycled to 100%.",ec3hx9a5,45981,44158,https://cqddatastore.blob.core.windows.net/cqd/images/3f5e68ae49fb47f0ba191cb24c19275e.png,,,"Hollow cross section steel shape, typically referred to as hollow structural section (HSS)",1000 kg,,,,PlantGroup,,,FALSE,,,,0.318,2.6,2.6,,,,,,

However, they also find application in vehicles and machines. Beam profiles have high bending and axial stiffness, much higher than for example solid square or round sections with the same cross-sectional area. Common beam profiles can have two planes of symmetry as H- or I-profiles or only one plane as U-profiles (channels). Beam profiles are usually manufactured via hot rolling but some special shapes can be produced by cutting steel plate appropriately and welding the pieces together. In the former instance, the steel, after melting and refining, is continuously cast to a fairly large square or rectangular section, called a bloom. This is then hot rolled, usually in an adapted medium-section mill in which pairs of horizontal and vertical rolls shape the beam profile appropriately. After rolling, they are cooled individually and cut to length. The steel grades used for beam profiles are most often weldable, low-carbon constructional steels with an iron content of 98% or more. As with other steel products, beam profiles used in building and civil engineering constructions can at the end of their useful life be recovered and recycled to 100%.",ec3feeb2,45981,44158,https://cqddatastore.blob.core.windows.net/cqd/images/871af167739f4ee6b6ab32cbee19cb40.png,,,"Steel shapes, such as angles, wide flange beams and I-beams, produced using a high temperature mill process.",1000 kg,,,,PlantGroup,,,FALSE,,,,0.15,1.15,1.15,,,,,,

The polyiso wall insulation boards consist of a foam core sandwiched between two facers (top and bottom). The foam core is comprised of a thermoset polymer that hardens by curing from a viscous liquid prepolymer. The rigid foam is produced through the reaction of methylene diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) with polyester polyol. Other additives such as catalyst, surfactant, flame retardant, and blowing agent (pentane or pentane blends) are part of the formulation. Pentane is a hydrocarbon with negligible ozone depletion potential (ODP) (U.S. EPA, 2018) and low global warming potential (GWP) (U.S. EPA, 2020). For nearly 20 years,
the polyiso industry has only utilized pentane or pentane blends in product formulations. Upon mixing of the components, the viscous pre-polymer is laid between the facers, and a chemical reaction cross-links polymer chains creating a rigid and durable cellular structure.

The Polyiso wall insulation boards consist
of a foam core sandwiched between two facers (top and bottom). The foam core is comprised of a thermoset polymer
that hardens by curing from a viscous liquid prepolymer. The rigid foam is produced through the reaction of methylene
diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) with polyester polyol. Other additives such as catalyst, surfactant, flame retardant, and
blowing agent (pentane or pentane blends) are part of the formulation. Pentane is a hydrocarbon with negligible ozone
depletion potential (ODP) (U.S. EPA, 2018) and low global warming potential (GWP) (U.S. EPA, 2020). For nearly 20
years, the polyiso industry has only utilized pentane or pentane blends in product formulations. Upon mixing of the
components, the viscous pre-polymer is laid between the facers, and a chemical reaction cross-links polymer chains
creating a rigid and durable cellular structure. For wall applications, this study considers one type of facer, a glass
reinforced aluminum foil facer, which plays a critical role in accommodating a continuous manufacturing process.",ec331xf0,46282,44456,https://cqddatastore.blob.core.windows.net/cqd/images/480ae916c21b4713b80d535336e88e92.png,,,"Rigid insulation products including rigid foams, wood fiberboard insulation, and rigid mineral wool boards",2.2 kg,,,,PlantGroup,,,FALSE,,,,0.274,4.2524467,4.2524467,,,,,,

It has third-party certified recycled content - certified by SCS Global Services - and, in addition is GREENGUARD Gold certified,
offers the industry’s only lifetime limited warranty.* FOAMULAR® NGX® XPS Insulation is made with Owens Corning’s
patented Hydrovac® process technology under strict quality control measures, which makes it highly resistant to moisture
and permits the product to retain its high R-value year after year even after prolonged exposure to moisture and freeze/thaw
cycling. Another primary difference with FOAMULAR ® NGX® XPS Insulation products is its compressive strength. FOAMULAR ®
NGX® XPS Insulation has compressive strengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60 and 100 psi. The variety of products provides
different strengths for use in walls, where there is almost no compressive load, or intermediate strength product for use
with modest loads such as around foundations, or in low slope roofs. It also is suitable for use under high load pavement,
such as floor slabs or plaza decks. FOAMULAR® NGX® contains the additional benefit of being manufactured with a blowing

EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and pressure forms large blocks of EPS.

Polyiso roof insulation boards consist of a
foam core sandwiched between two facers (top and bottom). The foam core is comprised of a thermoset polymer that
hardens by curing from a viscous liquid prepolymer. The rigid foam is produced through the reaction of methylene
diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) with polyester polyol. Other additives such as catalyst, surfactant, flame retardant, and
blowing agent (pentane or pentane blends) are part of the formulation. Pentane is a hydrocarbon with negligible ozone
depletion potential (ODP) (U.S. EPA, 2018) and low global warming potential (GWP) (U.S. EPA, 2020). For nearly 20 years, the
polyiso industry has only utilized pentane or pentane blends in product formulations. Upon mixing of the components, the
viscous pre-polymer is laid between the facers, and a chemical reaction cross-links polymer chains creating a rigid and
durable cellular structure. For roofing applications, the most common facer is a glass fiber reinforced cellulosic facer (GRF)
produced predominantly from recycled post-consumer and/or post-industrial fibers. Polyiso roof insulation is also
manufactured with polymer-bonded coated glass facer (CGF), consisting of a glass fiber mat coated with polymers. Both

This PVDF film is also anti-graffiti and non-stick, preventing organic matter from developing on the panel's surface and reducing the build-up of dust and dirt from ambient pollution.By the pool or spa we can also enjoy the beauty of a ProdIN product (by Prodema).

The production speed is depending on the thickness at 4 to 8 m/min. The rollforming process of the two steel faces starts on the winches. The profile types are related to a defined number of rolls, the higher the profiles the higher the number of rolls. The profiling process runs inside out, starting in the middle. PU sandwich panels are made by introducing the liquid polyurethane components within the subsequent foaming station, the foaming of the core. The element thickness is fixed by revolving steel plate conveyors. After leaving the reaction zone, the elements are cut to the ordering length. Following the elements through a cooling section into an automatically stacking system where they are stacked into transport and assembly compatible packages. The process ends here.

of the material include low moisture absorption, long service life and high compressive strength.
EPS is manufactured through permeating polystyrene beads with pentane, allowing the beads to expand when exposed to steam. This addition of
a so-called blowing agent adds 4% - 6% w/w. The expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads are then fed into a block molding machine, where steam and
pressure forms large blocks of EPS. The amount of EPS going into the mold determines the densitiy of the block, where pressure class 80 provides
a density at 80 kN/m2, which is approximately 16 kg/m3. After molding, the remaining blowing agent, pentane, is aired out and the blocks are cut

These glass wool fibres are formed into a “mineral wool mat” consisting of a soft, airy structure The best natural insulator on earth is dry immobile air at 10°C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in λ, is 0.025 W/(m.K) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of glass mineral wool is close to immobile air as its λ (Lambda) varies from 0.032 W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.044 W/(m.K) for the least. The glass mineral wool products have an entangled, porous structure: This enables air to become trapped in the pores of the material providing exceptional thermal properties. Furthermore, its porous and elastic structure absorbs noise in the air and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Incombustible by nature, Isover glass mineral wool does not fuel fire or propagate flames. Glass mineral wool insulation usage is extensive, ranging from use in building insulation (loft, cavity walls) to technical insulation (Industrial facilities, Marine & offshore). It ensures a high level of comfort, lowers energy costs, minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, prevents heat loss through pitched roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire. Moreover, Isover insulation allows substantial weight savings for marine applications. The glass mineral wool products generated at Saint - Gobain Isover UK have an average building lifespan of 60 years, or as long as the insulated building component is part of the building.

With its entangled structure, mineral wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs noise in the air, knocks and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Mineral wool containing incombustible materials does not fuel fire or propagate flames.
Glass wool insulation is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level of comfort, lowers energy costs, minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, prevents heat loss through pitched roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire.",ec37uqrw,46253,44428,https://cqddatastore.blob.core.windows.net/cqd/images/b7131c62a4794cc085685564d4d9ca75.png,,,"Rigid insulation products including rigid foams, wood fiberboard insulation, and rigid mineral wool boards",2.2 kg,,,,Plant,,,FALSE,,,,0.216,0.894,0.894,,,,,,

The bast hemp fibres are a soft, woody fibre obtained from the hemp stems and have a very high tensile strength. The hemp fibres are often used as a reinforcement in bio-composites and has very good thermal and acoustic insulating capacity. Ekolution® Hemp fibre Insulation is thus a bio-composite material that is very suitable for the construction sector. Ekolution® Hemp fibre insulation has several technical and environmental advantages: The industrial hemp binds large amounts of CO2 in a plant during its growth, faster than most other sources of biomass raw materials. Low-embodied energy High sorption capacity (moisture buffering) and effectively adjusting humidity levels High specific heat inertia, means that hemp fibre takes longer to heat and cool, resulting in less temperature variations in the material Reducing heat consumption and energy costs Breathable with diffusion-open designs and building techniques. Very good sound attenuating properties. Natural, healthy and anti-bacterial Ecological, zero harmful and non-toxic emissions. Simplified production process, as the fibre is organic and comfortable against the skin and respiratory tract. 100% recyclable and renewable product.

STYROFOAM™    extruded  polystyrene  foam  provides  an  R  value  of  5  h·ft2·°F/Btu  per  inch;  STYROFOAM™  Ultra  uses  patented  carbon  black  materials  in  the  foam  for  better  thermal  performance  over  other  extruded polystyrene foam insulations.

- the electricity consumption data of the membrane factory. The membrane factory also contains a production line not related to the production of
AMPHIBIA. To avoid attributing its consumption to AMPHIBIA products, it was estimated by means of power data and hours of use. The allocations between the different AMPHIBIA thicknesses for the energy consumption attributable to them were then made on a mass basis (kg products);
- the waste produced by the production process from the membrane department: raw material and additive waste, EPDM liner (waste from Amphibia) and water/sludge degassing. Waste was allocated on a mass basis (kg produced) for raw material waste and degassing. On the other hand, EPDM sheaths were allocated on a kg basis (waste).

The layers are bonded with carefully selected adhesives that are suitable for the respective purpose. CLT products are long-lasting and safe to use and recyclable. They are continuously tested to ensure that they meet the strictest requirements in terms of ambient air emissions. CLT also offers virtually boundless possibilities in terms of construction concept, style and architecture. Lightweight yet strong, with superior acoustic, fire, seismic, and thermal performance, CLT is currently being used in place of concrete, masonry and steel in the construction of residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Thanks to its inherent structural qualities, CLT presents no limitations to architecture. CLT resists high racking and compressive forces, so it can be especially cost-effective for multi-storey and long-span applications. Because of its dimensional stability and structural properties, this massive wooden product is well suited for floors, walls and roofs. CLT is a highly flexible wood product that is easily tailored for further processing. It can be used together with any building material. And compared with heavy mineral-based materials, CLT is easily moved by lighter cranes at the construction site.

glued together parallel to grain. Thanks to the initial
material being strength-graded and homogenisation
via its layered structure, it has improved properties and
has higher load-bearing capacities than conventional

manufactured as straight or curved beams. Apart from
monitoring required for technical approval,
manufacturing can also be subject to supplementary
private monitoring in accordance with the provisions of
the glued laminated timber monitoring symbol.
